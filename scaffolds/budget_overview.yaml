    remaining budget as opportunity.

  tone_variants:
    encouraging: Emphasize what's going well and frame overages as adjustable.
    strict: Lead with overages, quantify the gap, flag risk of overshoot.

reasoning_framework:
  steps:
    - Compare actual spending to budget for each category
    - Identify categories significantly over or under budget
    - Calculate overall budget utilization percentage
    - Summarize with the most important variance

domain_knowledge_activation:
  - Budget tracking is most useful mid-period when adjustments are still possible
  - Small overages in many categories matter more than one large overage
  - Under-budget categories can offset overages — show the net picture
